# ITMD442-LAB-1
 First lab for ITMD 442 - Full Stack Web Developlment

# Requirements
- Create a GitHub account if you don’t have one
- Create a new public Git repository on GitHub for this lab work. Include in the repository name which course number and lab (ITMD442-Lab1 or ITMD542-Lab or similar)
- Check the box to add a README file for future use
- Use your preferred method to interact with the Git repository and GitHub. Please do not
only interact with the repo in the GitHub UI. Use a client or command line on a local
copy and push commits to GitHub.
- Create an index.html file in the root of your repository.
- Create a webpage as the intro/landing page of your repository. This page should be an intro about you and the class. It can be like a resume or a less formal page about your interest. 
- Please include a photo of yourself on the page. 
- Add a CSS file and add CSS to this page. You can do whatever you want as a design but make it look the best you can. Any CSS frameworks are fine to use. I just want to see all elements on the page styled so they don’t look un-styled.
- Commit your files to your repository and GitHub often. I expect to see more than one commit for this work. I need to see multiple commits and pushes as you get parts of it together.
- Enable GitHub pages for this repository so your branch is served as a website.
- Submit your GitHub repo and pages URL to the Canvas assignment in the text field. I need to see your page hosted on GitHub pages not just the repo code
