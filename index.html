        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am a third year undergrad in ITM working hard to specialize in web development!</p>
        <p>
          My minor is in public administration and my goal is to one day work at a web development firm. My
          interest in the field started when my dad let me help around his sign making business and my
          brother showed me the ropes in graphic design. When I found out that there was a way to
          combine design with computers, I was sold on the idea of web design and dev. I might go a little 
          over the top with my design choices sometimes, but I just love designing pretty and functional websites.
